This program plays tic tac toe using the minimax tree search. It checks the available moves, and determines which one is best recursively. The value of each potential move is determined by the moves afterward, all the way down to the end of the game. This is a fine way to play TTT, but not the best for games like Chess or Go. For that, you need something trickier, like Monte Carlo Search Tree. I'm working on that now. More to come...
